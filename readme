Hypothesis: "Lower-ranked players (outside the top 50) have a higher chance of defeating top 10 players in Grand Slams compared to ATP 250/500 tournaments."

1. Collect all grandslam tennis matches from 2000 - 2025
2. Filter this data for matches where 1 player is top 10 and the other player is outisde the top 50
3. Complete the same steps for ATP 250 & 500 tournaments
